 Single Page ReactJS Application with Express API Backend
Application Requirements
Single Page ReactJS Application with Express API backend:

Client Side Code

ReactJS only
Must respond to user interaction and provide data from your Express API
Must have a parent component that stores state
Must have nested / child components
Use external CSS file, styling should be done using the "className" attribute
Server Side Code

Must follow RESTful API convention
Well formatted and indented code
You will need to enable CORS
Database

Must have atleast 1 table that stores User data
Workflow

Must show frequent commits, latest code pushed to github
Bonus

Incorporate an external library or API (beware of picking an API without doing research first, make sure it is open or if it needs a key that you can get one quickly!)
