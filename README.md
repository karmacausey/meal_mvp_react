# meal_mvp_react
Refactor of MealMVP into a react MVP project

This project will borrow from the design of my Meal MVP project, but will use a React front end. Initial stage for this project will meet Minimum Viability Requirements as stated in our class assignment:

React FullStack MVP
In this project you will be combining your ability to create a React application with building an ExpressJS API in order to build a modern full stack application!

Prerequisites
Skills:

Setting up and running a ReactJS application
How to build a frontend ReactJS applicaion using stateful and non-stateful components
How to make AJAX calls from the client side to your API
CSS: Selectors, properties, how to align elements
How to handle CORS issues
Concepts:

CORS
Stateful Components
Props
Working with Classes
Passing functions down as props /w parent component binding
Nesting / Creating Child Components.
Passing State data down as props
Deliverables
Before Writing ANY Code:

 Create Page Wireframe that shows what the User will see when the page loads (see previous lessons)

Single Page ReactJS Application with Express API Backend
Application Requirements
Single Page ReactJS Application with Express API backend:

Client Side Code

ReactJS only
Must respond to user interaction and provide data from your Express API
Must have a parent component that stores state
Must have nested / child components
Use external CSS file, styling should be done using the "className" attribute
Server Side Code

Must follow RESTful API convention
Well formatted and indented code
You will need to enable CORS
Database

Must have atleast 1 table that stores User data
Workflow

Must show frequent commits, latest code pushed to github
Bonus

Incorporate an external library or API (beware of picking an API without doing research first, make sure it is open or if it needs a key that you can get one quickly!)

Current Project Progress 6/21/2022: I started the project by converting most of my original MVP project front end into function based react componenets. I then began to implement the views that match with the wireframes for this project. I dealt with CORS issues and server configuration questions over the first day by doing reasearch. This is the first time I have built a project with function based react. I watched the two video's that my instructor left for us that taught about Routes and controlled components. I chose not to implement Routes yet based on my low level of understanding, as well as the short length of time we have available for this MVP project. I currently have the Add a new User Function and Login Pages working, as well as the Search function which uses an external API. I reconfigured my database during the process and streamlined how it stores favorites and retrieves them. This fixes a bug from the original MVP project where it would store image URL's that would time out and have broken links. My latest addition was to allow the user to click searched recipes to save them. I also allow them to delete them from the favorites section by clicking them. I would like to add more interactive components like back buttons and modals in the next step, but currently have full functionality for the MVP requirements.
